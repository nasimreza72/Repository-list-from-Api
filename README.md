# Minireact!

First investigate the files in this project. Take plenty of time just to read the existing code.

In `App.jsx` you fill find a `data` variable - I want the App component to render out that data into the browser. Should be a `<table>`? Or `<ul>`? Or card elements? Choose your destiny!

Make sure to add at least some CSS!

Also edit the data generator function and add extra data to print - perhaps a phone number? ðŸ¤”
